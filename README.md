webdb_dictionary_flashcards
===========================

A place to add things that you want to learn/memorize. It's something between a dictionary and flash cards.  

Add phrases and definitions, randomize them, click to hide/show definitions, export/import them as CSV. 

They are saved in your own browser db so only you have access.
