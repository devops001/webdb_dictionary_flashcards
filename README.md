webdb_dictionary_flashcards
===========================

A place to add things that you want to learn/memorize. It is something between a dictionary and flash cards.  

I created this for myself to help myself learn the Pali language (heh, my self :)). 

Add phrases and definitions, randomize them, click to hide/show definitions, filter with regular expressions, export/import them as CSV. 

They are saved in your own browser db so only you have access.

To use:

* Open the single_file.html file in a modern browser.

To change:

* Make changes the seperate files (html, javascript, css), then run the Ruby "compile.rb" script to create a single html file.
